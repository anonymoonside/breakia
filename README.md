# breakia
Breakia is a simple AI experiment designed to play a Breakout-style game built in Python with Pygame.
This project was my very first attempt at both Python and reinforcement learning, so youâ€™ll find that all variables and comments are still written in French.

What libs: 
- Pygame
- Random
- Numpy

How it works:
- The AI is trained with a Q-Learning algorithm.
- The environment is a Breakout clone built in Pygame, simplified and broken down into several parts to reduce the number of possible cases.
- At each step, the AI chooses an action (move left, move right, or stay still).
- It receives a reward based on the outcome (e.g., hitting the ball vs. losing a life).
- Over time, it updates its Q-table to maximize rewards and improve performance.

Features:
- Basic Q-Learning implementation
- Simple Pygame environment (Breakout clone)
- Educational project to understand how reinforcement learning works in games

Notes:
- This is my first real Python project, so the code may not be perfect.
- All variables and comments are currently in French.
- The AI works surprisingly well given its simplicity.

Future Improvements:
- Clean up and translate the code to English
- Add visualizations of the training process
- Experiment with other RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Networks)
